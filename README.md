An interactive Python application that visualizes different pathfinding, as well as maze generation computer algorithms for the user.  
This is a personal project for the purposes of learning and improving, made using the pygame module.

## Features
Graphical user interface, with the ability to place the starting/target position as well as walls on the grid.  
  
  
### Currently supports the following path finding algorithms  
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- A* search (Manhattan distance heuristic, FIFO tie-breaker)
- Greedy best first search (Manhattan distance heuristic, FIFO tie-breaker)
- Bidirectional BFS
  
  
### Currently supports the following maze generation algorithms  
- Recursive division  
  
  
### Other
- Function for random wall placement  

## To Do
- Add more maze generation algorithms.
- Add configurable settings.
