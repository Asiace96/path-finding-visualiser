Path finding visualization project made in python using the pygame module.  
  
This is a personal project for the purposes of learning and improving.  

## Features
Graphical user interface.  
  
Currently supports the following path finding algorithms:  
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- A* search
- Greedy best first search  
  
Currently supports the following maze generation algorithms:  
- Recursive division  
  
## TBD  
- Add more maze generation algorithms for the grid.
- Add configurable settings.
